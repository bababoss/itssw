# Intelligent Real-time  Traffic Security and Surveillance in wild(IRTSSW)

Current traffic infrastructure for vehicle security and surveillance is not so good. There is no security and surveillance for any accident, unregistered vehicle, speed violation, traffic rule violation, traffic activity recognition etc. We are proposing an artificial intelligence based solution to solve all these problems. We have built a smart traffic camera and analytics AI engine for quick, real-time response to traffic enforcement authorities and medical emergency response teams. It will recognize license plate number, detect traffic rule violation like lane departure warning, traffic signal violation, speed violation etc. in real-time. We trained a state of the art multi-stage deep learning model for vehicle and license plate detection, license plate recognition, traffic rule violation detector etc.  We got 99% accuracy for vehicle detection and 95% accuracy with testing accuracy for LP(license plate) text recognition. We created 4000 "Indian vehicle" label image dataset with different camera and environment conditions.

We have built smart camera using state of the art deep learning and edge intelligence. We have optimized code and trained model for running prediction or inference on the edge devices (at the smart camera).  All of the detection and recognition task will run on the smart camera. We used Intel Movidius compute device for DL model inference. Smart camera will give real-time warning for unregistered vehicle, traffic rule violation and accident, to traffic enforcement authorities and medical emergency response teams.

This smart camera will solve traffic security issues and surveillance problem in real-time making 'Smart Transport Infrastructure' . This camera can be used in a lot of application areas related to  vehicle security and surveillance.
